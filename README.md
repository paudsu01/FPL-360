## Overview
FPL-360 is a "helper" extension for the Fantasy Premier League(FPL) website game. It was made initially to just show away kits for away fixtures in the website. However, the extension now supports more features such as showing the next few fixtures, last few gameweek points, net transfers, profit-loss made on players etc.
You can learn more about the extension on the webstore page.
